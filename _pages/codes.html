  <p>
    In this section I share simple replication codes for papers that I have worked on using Julia.
    These implementations are meant to help others understand and reproduce the key results from these papers.
    All code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/marco-pina/Utilities" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note: These implementations are the result of my own learning process and may not perfectly replicate the original papers.
    While the codes might be incomplete or contain simplifications, they may still be useful for understanding the models and methods.</em>
  </p>
