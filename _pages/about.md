I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Virginia. My research interests are primarily in the fields of macrofinance and computational economics.

Specifically, my current work investigates credit cycles, financial frictions, and macroprudential policies in emerging and developing economies. I employ computational techniques to construct and estimate both partial and general equilibrium models for the analysis of macroeconomic policy and financial markets. Additionally, I model financial time series using econometric methods for applications in forecasting and quantitative risk management.

This website serves as a platform to showcase my research and provide access to relevant code. I am always open to engaging with fellow researchers and practitioners to discuss research ideas in macrofinance and financial econometrics.
