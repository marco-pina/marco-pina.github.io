<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Virginia, specializing in macrofinance and computational economics.</p>

<p>My research focuses on financial stability in emerging economies, where shallow financial systems and volatile capital flows can amplify shocks. I seek to understand why some economies escape recurring financial crises while others remain vulnerable, emphasizing the role of financial frictions and macroprudential policy design. Currently, I am also exploring the implications of transformative AI (TAI) for financial stability.</p>

<p>To address these questions, I use both structural and empirical approaches, combining modern techniques in computational methods, econometrics, and machine learning.</p>

<p>This website hosts my research and replication code. I am always open to discussing new ideas and collaborations in macrofinance.</p>
